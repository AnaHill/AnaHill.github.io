<!-- ### Part-Time Researcher  / Visiting Scholar ### -->
## 🤓 Visiting Scholar @Tampere University (_Nov 2022 - Dec 2024_)
Continued as a part-time researcher (approx. 10 hours/month) in [Micro- and Nanosystems Research Group](https://research.tuni.fi/mst/) led by Professor Pasi Kallio.
- **🚀 Research areas**: lab-on-a-chip, vascularization, data analysis, fuzzy control
- **🛠️ Main tools**: MATLAB, Simulink, COMSOL (FEM)

During this time, we finished following three publications 📝.

> 🚀 <span id="vascularization"> *Bringing the future of tissue engineering one step closer!* 🧫 </span>

I led a **multidisciplinary research team** that developed a groundbreaking **"body-on-a-chip" platform** for studying vascularized **3D cell co-cultures**. Our team introduced an **innovative open-top microfluidic chip** that enables the cultivation of **two distinct 3D cell cultures** within a single device—**without physical barriers**. This breakthrough technology opens new possibilities for **studying cell-cell interactions** in a precisely controlled microenvironment and advancing **drug testing** applications. Read more:

</div>

> 🎚️ <span id="fuzzy_control"> *Control the beating of cardiomyocyte cultures - by temperature!* 🌡️  

I developed **fuzzy controllers and mathematical models to simulate and control temperature-dependency of beating human cardiomyocyte cultures**. This research offers valuable guidance for scientists aiming to **standardize experimental conditions** and **improve the reliability of cardiomyocyte cell cultures**. Read more:

> 📈 *Truely understand the field potential signals* 📊 

I encapsulated my extensive experience in **analyzing field potential (FP) signals derived from 2D human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures**. 

While developing the [**DatAnalyzer**](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer "DatAnalyzer") software, I observed a wide array of methodologies used for FP signal analysis across various studies. Driven by realization of this inconsistency, I dedicated significant effort to produce an academically rigorous report that—despite not undergoing formal peer-review process—offers valuable **insights and guidance for researchers analyzing FP signals**. More information on DatAnalyzer [**repo**](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer "DatAnalyzer repo") and in the following article:

## 👨‍💻 Own projects
Here, I list some of my research projects I have created during my academic career.

<!-- DatAnalyzer -->

- ⚡ **Role:** Creator
- ✅ **Key Contributions:** Developed tools to load, analyze, and visualize data, especially electrical biosignals
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack:** MATLAB
- 🏷️ **Key Words:** data analysis, MEA, field potential, hiPS-CM
- 🔗 **References:** [DatAnalyzer home page](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer "DatAnalyzer repo") and publication _Opinion: The correct way to analyze FP signals_ in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10205591)

I developed **DatAnalyzer** software to analyze field potential (FP) signals from human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures.
