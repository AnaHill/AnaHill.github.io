<!-- ### Part-Time Researcher  / Visiting Scholar ### -->
## Visiting Scholar @Tampere University (_Nov 2022 - Dec 2024_)
Continued as a part-time researcher (approx. 10 hours/month) in [Micro- and Nanosystems Research Group](https://research.tuni.fi/mst/) led by Professor Pasi Kallio to finish the following three publications.

> 🚀 *Bringing the future of tissue engineering one step closer!*  

I led a **multidisciplinary research team** that developed a groundbreaking **"lab-on-a-chip" platform** for studying vascularized **3D cell co-cultures**. Our team introduced an **innovative open-top microfluidic chip** that enables the cultivation of **two distinct 3D cell cultures** within a single device—**without physical barriers**. This breakthrough technology opens new possibilities for **studying cell-cell interactions** in a precisely controlled microenvironment and advancing **drug testing** applications.

> 🎛️ *Control the beating of cardiomyocyte cultures - by temperature!*  

I developed a fuzzy controller and a mathematical model to simulate and control temperature-dependency of beating human cardiomyocyte cultures. This research offers valuable guidance for scientists aiming to standardize experimental conditions and improve the reliability of cardiomyocyte-based assays.

  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

> 🎛️ *Truely understand the field potential signals*  

In November 2023, I published a comprehensive report titled **"Opinion: The correct way to analyze FP signals"**. This work encapsulates my extensive experience in analyzing **field potential (FP) signals** derived from **2D human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures**. 
<details>
  <summary><strong>Show more</strong></summary>  

While developing the **DatAnalyzer** software ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), I observed a wide array of methodologies used for FP signal analysis across various studies. This inconsistency often led to confusion, highlighting the need for a **cohesive analytical framework**.  
 
Driven by this realization, I dedicated significant effort to produce an academically rigorous report that—despite not undergoing formal peer review process—offers valuable **insights and guidance** for researchers navigating the complexities of FP signal analysis.

<!-- ### Postdoc ### -->
## Postdoctoral Research Fellow @Tampere University (_Sep 2018 - Nov 2022_)
My research focused on **microsystems**, **microfluidics**, **control engineering**, **data analysis** with MATLAB.
My main tools were **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, **COMSOL (FEM)**, and **soft lithography (PDMS)**.

I worked as a postdoc in professor Pasi Kallio's team [1, 2](), where I developed data engineering and analysis solutions to automatize data analysis of several challenging biosignals and data types (e.g. HDF5, .csv, image, and video). My work involved GUI development and implementation of machine learning solutions in MATLAB environment. [3-8]()

Additionally, I worked as professor Kallio’s Vice-PI in a multidisciplinary CoEBoC team [2]() combining cell biologists and engineers, and led a group of researchers developing a novel "body-on-chip" platform for vascularized 3D cell co-cultures studies [11]().
