<!-- ### Part-Time Researcher  / Visiting Scholar ### -->
## 🤓 Visiting Scholar @Tampere University (_Nov 2022 - Dec 2024_)
Continued as a part-time researcher (approx. 10 hours/month) in [Micro- and Nanosystems Research Group](https://research.tuni.fi/mst/) led by Professor Pasi Kallio.
- **🚀 Research areas**: lab-on-a-chip, vascularization, data analysis, fuzzy control
- **🛠️ Main tools**: MATLAB, Simulink, COMSOL (FEM)

During this time, we finished following three publications.

> 🚀 *Bringing the future of tissue engineering one step closer!* 🧫 

I led a **multidisciplinary research team** that developed a groundbreaking **"lab-on-a-chip" platform** for studying vascularized **3D cell co-cultures**. Our team introduced an **innovative open-top microfluidic chip** that enables the cultivation of **two distinct 3D cell cultures** within a single device—**without physical barriers**. This breakthrough technology opens new possibilities for **studying cell-cell interactions** in a precisely controlled microenvironment and advancing **drug testing** applications. Read more:

> 🎚️ *Control the beating of cardiomyocyte cultures - by temperature!* 🌡️  

I developed **fuzzy controllers and mathematical models to simulate and control temperature-dependency of beating human cardiomyocyte cultures**. This research offers valuable guidance for scientists aiming to **standardize experimental conditions** and **improve the reliability of cardiomyocyte cell cultures**. Read more:

> 📈 *Truely understand the field potential signals* 📊 

I encapsulated my extensive experience in **analyzing field potential (FP) signals derived from 2D human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures**. 

While developing the **DatAnalyzer** software, I observed a wide array of methodologies used for FP signal analysis across various studies. Driven by realization of this inconsistency, I dedicated significant effort to produce an academically rigorous report that—despite not undergoing formal peer-review process—offers valuable **insights and guidance** for researchers analyzing FP signals.

## <span id="DatAnalyzer">📊 DatAnalyzer: The correct way to analyze FP signals</span>
Tools to load, visualize, and analyse data using MATLAB.
- [DatAnalyzer home page](https://github.com/AnaHill/DatAnalyzer)  
- Publication _Opinion: The correct way to analyze FP signals_ available in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10205591)

Tools and keywords: **MATLAB**, **data analysis**, **MEA**, **hiPS-CM**

Developed method and tool (DatAnalyzer) to analyze field potential (FP) signals from 2D human induced pluripotent stem cells derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) cultures. I summarized how FP signals have been analyzed various, sometimes even contradictory, ways in the literature, and proposed my own methdod that could be considered.

## <span id="DocLaTex">📄✍️ Write LaTeX documents together with co-authors that use MS Word</span>
Project [page](https://github.com/AnaHill/Write-LaTeX-documents-using-Word) explains how to use this tool.

Tools: **Powershell**, **Pandoc**, **LaTeX**, **Markdown**

Do you want to use LaTeX for you (scientific) paper, but struggling when co-authors, such as you supervisor, do not use it, and therefore Word is preferred? This is tool for you! Minimize hasszle of exporting files in different formats and copy-paste text from one format to another, while still be able to write LaTeX-documents and publish high-quality papers.

For example, following paper freely available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242335) was written using this tool:
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
  {% for pub in site.data.publications %}
