See [Jekyll's info about drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts)

> Drafts are **posts without a date** in the filename. They’re **posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet**. To get up and running with drafts, create a _drafts folder in your site’s root and create your first draft:

```
.
├── _drafts
│   └── a-draft-post.md
...
```

> To preview your site with drafts, run jekyll serve or jekyll build with the --drafts switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
