Besides data engineer tasks like developing and maintaining data pipelines and their monitoring systems, I have e.g. created a machine learning based recommendation system that was integrated to data pipelines for analysis and visualization purposes.

In smaller customer projects and inhouse trainings I have developed & deployed Azure resources by using Bicep and Azure Pipelines, build & used Snowflake & Crosser combination to ingest and analyze industrial data ( IIoT, Industrial IoT and OT-IT convergence), learnt data modeling techniques and especially Data Vault & ADE (Agile Data Engine), and built reports and analysis tools using Power BI.

Passionate data professional with a strong analytical background. Over two years, I have helped customers from different sectors (public domain and retail, energy, and mobile network industries) to build robust and scalable data solutions. 


## Solita inhouse trainings
- Data Academy: 5 weeks long training with SQL, Python & git, data modeling, Power BI, Data Vault & ADE (Agile Data Engine), Snowflake, 
- Data Architecht
- ADE
- Industrial Data Hothouse: a-month long inhouse training taught multiple data engineering and industrial skills, for example Python, Docker, IIoT (Industrial IoT) and OT-IT convergence.
