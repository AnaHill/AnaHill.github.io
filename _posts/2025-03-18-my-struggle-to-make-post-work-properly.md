In this post, I'll be documenting my journey to make these blog posts, like this, work probably. Originally, idea was to demonstrate how a markdown file is converted to a blog post. But, because of problems reported below, this turned to be documentation of the problem.

# This is H1 title text
Above text is written as `# This is H1 title text`. If working properly, it should use H1 level style based on theme I have applied, currently merlot. Example, how this `H1` text should look can be found e.g. on my main page like
[here](https://anahill.github.io/#-explore-more)https://anahill.github.io/#-explore-more

Currently, it is merlot hYou will notice, how this differs from the following

<h1 style="font-size: 2.2em; color: #600000; font-weight: bold;">This is H1 title text with `h1` tage and attributes </h1>


## Second level heading
Typically, I use this in my blog post; title in layout is 'reserver' for "H1 level headings".

### Third level heading
Outcome is like this when make heading with three `###`.

#### Fourth last time
style.css should now include definition for also forth level headings `####`.
