In this post, I will explain how you can start with GitHub Pages.
As an example, I'll show how I set-up my [main page](https://anahill.github.io/) and created a FREE 🤑 [work portfolio](https://anahill.github.io/work.html).


<strong><big> I don't try to invent the wheel again </big></strong>  
👉 So, check the [links I provide in the end](#ref), first three links will guide you to set up your portfolio.  
...except one thing I recommend you to do🚨  
<strong><big>  Use `index.md` for main page of GitHub Pages and `readme.md`</big></strong>  
... trust me, you will thank me for this! Next, I will explain why.

## How to set-up your main page
### Step1: Create a repo (`username.github.io`) and set-up `index.md` and `readme.md` files
First, create a **public** repo named as `username.github.io`.

After you have created a repo (be sure that your **repo is public**, otherwise this wont't work!)
- add `index.md` file to your main folder 
- keep your `readme.md` minimal, I recommend to add link your main page when it is ready.

As an example, see `readme.md` and `index.md` in my repo
- my [repo page](https://github.com/AnaHill/AnaHill.github.io "https://github.com/AnaHill/AnaHill.github.io") shows what is written in `readme.md`
- whereas, my `index.md` is the code that will be deployed to Github Pages using Github actions
  - my`index.md` raw code can be check [here](https://github.com/AnaHill/AnaHill.github.io/blob/main/index.md?plain=1 "https://github.com/AnaHill/AnaHill.github.io/blob/main/index.md?plain=1") 
  - my `readme.md` mainly provides links to web pages, see below shortened example what `readme.md` could contain.
