{% include blog-meta.html %}

> ðŸ˜Ž Nerd your day! ðŸ¤“  

## Update on April, 2025
I found, if not a solution, at least a workaround; with the use `blog-meta.html` file (see [here](https://github.com/AnaHill/AnaHill.github.io/blob/main/_includes/blog-meta.html "blog-meta.html file")). Basically,
- now all blog post are using default theme with `layout: default` (instead of `layout: post` that was used previously)
- metadata like "_Published on_" etc are included with `include blog-meta.html` command
- I add links to my blog list and main page in **each blog post file**
  - this is a bit bummer, and therefore my previously used "post.html" method, described [here](https://anahill.github.io/blog/learn-write-posts.html), would have been better.

<figcaption><em>Blog post workaround: 1) change layout from post to default, 2) include blog-meta.html, and 3) include links to my blog list and main page.</em></figcaption>  

Why my `post.html` approach does not work? 
To be honest, I do not know for sure, but based on discussion I had with our own ðŸ¤– friend chat-GPT, its suggestion seems reasonable: 
> Thatâ€™s called a layout chaining technique, where `post.html` extends `default.html`. That part is totally fine in theory â€” but in practice, your **_layouts/post.html doesn't contain any actual HTML** content
> 
> And hereâ€™s the issue: **Jekyll does not render the front matter from a layout file like a normal page/post**. The layout: default inside post.html is ignored. So even though it looks like you're inheriting from default, you're actually notâ€”and thatâ€™s why your post page has no CSS or structure applied.

Please do not hesitate to reach me out if you know, how I can fix this! âœ‰ï¸Ž

## Previous text 

In this post, I'll be documenting my journey to make my blog posts, like this, work probably. Originally, idea was to demonstrate how a markdown file is converted to a blog post. But, because of problems reported below, this turned to be documentation of the problem. Let's see if I find any solution! 

I noticed problems related to blog post pages from the headings; they are just not implemented as they should. So, let's deep dive into the problem!

# This is H1 title text
Above text is written as `# This is H1 title text`. If working properly, it should use H1 level style based on theme I have applied, currently merlot. Example, how this `H1` text should look can be found e.g. on my main page like [H1 level anahill.github.io/#-explore-more](https://anahill.github.io/#-explore-more "anahill.github.io/#-explore-more"). 

Same goes lower level `H2`heading, example how it should look like is 
[anahill.github.io/work.html#-own-projects](https://anahill.github.io/work.html#-own-projects "anahill.github.io/work.html#-own-projects")

In the following pic, I try to demonstrate this: You do not need to be a sherlock to see the difference! ðŸ¤“ 
![comparison_of_heading_](/pics/posts/compare_correct_headings_to_current_post.png "Properly applied headings on the left vs headings on this blog post (right)")
<figcaption><em>
Properly styled headings (left) vs headings at the time of writing when merlot theme is not applied as it should (right)
.</em></figcaption>

## H2 level heading
Above line is H2 title text starting with two `##`. 

# Check how H1 looks 
Above line is created with `#` tag, so it should use header level 1 style. You can see the difference if you use e.g. the following code.

```html
<h1 style="font-size: 2.2em; color: #600000; font-weight: bold;">
    This is H1 title text with `h1` tag and attributes written in html 
</h1>
```

Above code result following heading text.

<h1 style="font-size: 2.2em; color: #600000; font-weight: bold;">
This is H1 title text with `h1` tag and attributes written in html 
</h1>

After page is built, you can see the outcome; so yes, probably I could always manually apply html to each headings in my blog posts, but I do not want to do that.

![manual_h1_title](/pics/posts/manual_h1_title_outcome.png "how manually written h1 text is shown currently")

Let's test pure h1 element also, below I have written `<h1> Pure h1 element, no attributes included </h1>`.

<h1> Pure h1 element, no attributes included </h1>

### Third level heading
Outcome is like this when make heading with three `###`. At the time of writing, outcome is same as higher level headings.

#### Fourth last time
Same goes this: style.css should now include definition for also forth level headings `####`, but you can see the outcome.
