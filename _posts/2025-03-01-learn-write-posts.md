# How to write blog post using Jekyll and Github Pages
This is my first blog post to learn how to combine Jekyll and Github pages.

Briefly,
1. add `_post` folder
2. add markdown file `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`, example this post `2025-03-01-learn-write-posts.md`

Links used
- [GitHub Docs to add content with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)
- [Jekyll's documentation about posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
